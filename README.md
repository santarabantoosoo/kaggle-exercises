# kaggle-exercises    

The aim of this repo is to practice using python for data science. 

I will attempt to solve kaggle tutorials found in this link [Learn Python, Data Viz, Pandas & More | Tutorials | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview)

Future aims: (not yet implemented)

I will work on datasets to extend upon kaggle exercises.
